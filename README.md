# C_Convert_to_Assembly

In this project, it is aimed to convert the assembly file created with basic assembly commands into .cpp file created with basic C commands.

NOT:
1. The program must be in the same folder as the .cpp file. (Files with .c extension give an error.)
2. In the C code to be translated, the main function '{' sign must be adjacent to the function. (example: int main(){ )
3. It cannot convert non-main functions and for, if, ifelse structures.
4. It may take a long time to open the program :)
